# UX

### Site Purpose
The website contains a quiz that have 3 levels 'Easy', 'Medium' and 'Hard'. Each level consist of 5 unique questions about India. When the user give correct answer of a question it will add 10 points to the users score. Whereas for every incorrect answer the user will loose 5 points. By default, the game will start from 'Easy' level. But the user have option to choose either 'Medium' or 'Hard' difficulty levels as well. There are no limit how many times a user can restart this game or a level of game. For each question, the user is able to verify immediately if they answered correctly and if that is not the case, the correct answer is displayed with an alert message. Along with the final score, a message is displayed to congratulate the users or encourage them to take the quiz again.

### Audience
Anyone who has interest in this beautiful. historical rich, culturally diverse country called INDIA and wants to test how much they know about it.

### Communication
The overall design was kept extremely simple on purpose: the user can can read about the quiz and its rules about how much score is going to be awared for each correct answer as well as what panelty of score they have to pay for incorrect answer. As soon as user enter its name and choose level of difficulty based upon its comfort the quiz will start with respective difficulty level of questions. The visual structure of the quiz makes it intuitive to go through the 5 questions of each level. The user is notified of their final score after answering the last question of each level.

### User Goals
Challenge the user to test their knowledge and find the correct answers to the quiz. If they wish to retake the quiz at the end to better their score, a button is displayed to start the quiz again with same difficulty level or another button with the option to change the level of difficulty.

### Future Goals
Add some question with some images, audio or visual capability to engage the user more. The user would also be more engaged to complete the quiz if a timer was displayed with limited amount of time to answer each question.

# Design

# Testing

The site has been tested on a variety of mobile devices (iphone (iOS), OnePlus(Android)) as well as different web browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Edge) and all links, information about quiz, questions & options has functioned as it should. All input fields and options are required to be filled/clicked by the user before submitting.

I personally tested the site extensively with Google Chrome dev tools to ensure the site works responsively not only on mobile devices but also on medium to larger screens.

One of the biggest problems I encountered from the beginning handling css on different webpages. Then I took help from Love Math project as well as w3school and stackoverflow websites (mentioned in credits as well).

Writing JavaScript functions to display 1 question at a time on the quiz page was the biggest challenge during this project. I have referred various code available on Stackoverflow website as well as couple of github project shared by my mentor "Martina Terlevic". With the help of all those code I am able to write the best fit code as per my current understanding of JavaScript.

Some improvements are done on HTML pages after testing them on W3C Validator.

# Credits

I have really enjoyed the Code Institute course up till now, and I am looking forward to the next units of the course. I wanted to thank the Slack Community for their support learning the content and my Mentor Martina for her guidance with this project and assurances that creating a website is not as scary as I initially thought.

As a starting point I looked at the Love Maths projects.

- From the Love Maths Project, I took inspiration about how to include JavaScript along with HTML and CSS.
- Friends Trivia Quiz, My mentor has shared the GitHub repository created by Ila Bura. It helped me in great deal to understand and write JavaScripts functions and handle media queries in better way.
- W3School and Stackoverflow, I have referred these website to fix various issue that I faced while writing various types of code (CSS/JavaScript) for the website.
